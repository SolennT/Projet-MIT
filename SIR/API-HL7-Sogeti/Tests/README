Two high-level tests are implemented:
- Client: this test build a GUI to generate client HL7 messages and send them to the server
- Server: this program helps to set up and start a HL7 server

Both tests can be/have to be used at the same time.

This directory contains:
- Sources: netbeans project containing the sources of the tests
- Dist: distribution (jar that can be run independantly, see their README files for more information)
